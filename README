DESCRIPTION

This package implements SQL templates.  This allows the programmer to
increase the separation between the SQL RDBMS and the Perl programming
logic of any project.  This package has features that make it
particularly useful in a web environment, as it is quite easy to write
a CGI program to allow testing and evalutation of the SQL templates.

See CAM::SQLObject for a nice OO interface to database structures
returned by the CAM::SQLManager XML queries.
